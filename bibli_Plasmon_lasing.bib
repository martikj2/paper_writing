	abstract = {Periodic dielectric structures are typically integrated with a planar waveguide to create photonic band-edge modes for feedback in one-dimensional distributed feedback lasers and two-dimensional photonic-crystal lasers. Although photonic band-edge lasers are widely used in optics and biological applications, drawbacks include low modulation speeds and diffraction-limited mode confinement. In contrast, plasmonic nanolasers can support ultrafast dynamics and ultrasmall mode volumes. However, because of the large momentum mismatch between their nanolocalized lasing fields and free-space light, they suffer from large radiative losses and lack beam directionality. Here, we report lasing action from band-edge lattice plasmons in arrays of plasmonic nanocavities in a homogeneous dielectric environment. We find that optically pumped, two-dimensional arrays of plasmonic Au or Ag nanoparticles surrounded by an organic gain medium show directional beam emission (divergence angle {\textless}1.5° and linewidth {\textless}1.3 nm) characteristic of lasing action in the far-field, and behave as arrays of nanoscale light sources in the near-field. Using a semi-quantum electromagnetic approach to simulate the active optical responses, we show that lasing is achieved through stimulated energy transfer from the gain to the band-edge lattice plasmons in the deep subwavelength vicinity of the individual nanoparticles. Using femtosecond-transient absorption spectroscopy, we verified that lattice plasmons in plasmonic nanoparticle arrays could reach a 200-fold enhancement of the spontaneous emission rate of the dye because of their large local density of optical states.},

	abstract = {We use high-quality electrodynamics methods to study the extinction spectra of one-dimensional linear chains and two-dimensional planar arrays of spherical silver nanoparticles, placing emphasis on the variation of the plasmon resonance wavelength and width with array structure (spacing, symmetry), particle size, and polarization direction. Two levels of theory have been considered, coupled dipoles with fully retarded interactions and T-matrix theory that includes a converged multipole expansion on each particle. We find that the most important array effects for particles having a radius of 30 nm or smaller are captured by the couple dipole approach. Our calculations demonstrate several surprising effects that run counter to conventional wisdom in which the particle interactions are assumed to be governed by electrostatic dipolar interactions. In particular, we find that for planar arrays of particles with polarization parallel to the plane the plasmon resonance blue shifts as array spacing D decreases for D larger than about 75 nm and then it red shifts for smaller spacings. In addition, we find that the plasmon narrows for D {\textgreater} 180 nm but broadens for smaller spacings. The results can be rationalized using a simple analytical model, which demonstrates that the plasmon wavelength shift is determined by the real part of the retarded dipole sum while the width is determined by the imaginary part of this sum. The optimal blue shifts and narrowing are found when the particle spacing is slightly smaller than the plasmon wavelength, while red shifts and broadening can be found for spacings much smaller than the plasmon wavelength at which electrostatic interactions are dominant. We also find that the array spectrum does not change significantly with array symmetry (square or hexagonal) or irradiated spot size (i.e., constant array size or constant particle number).},

	abstract = {Laser science has been successful in producing increasingly high-powered, faster and smaller coherent light sources. Examples of recent advances are microscopic lasers that can reach the diffraction limit, based on photonic crystals, metal-clad cavities and nanowires. However, such lasers are restricted, both in optical mode size and physical device dimension, to being larger than half the wavelength of the optical field, and it remains a key fundamental challenge to realize ultracompact lasers that can directly generate coherent optical fields at the nanometre scale, far beyond the diffraction limit. A way of addressing this issue is to make use of surface plasmons, which are capable of tightly localizing light, but so far ohmic losses at optical frequencies have inhibited the realization of truly nanometre-scale lasers based on such approaches. A recent theoretical work predicted that such losses could be significantly reduced while maintaining ultrasmall modes in a hybrid plasmonic waveguide. Here we report the experimental demonstration of nanometre-scale plasmonic lasers, generating optical modes a hundred times smaller than the diffraction limit. We realize such lasers using a hybrid plasmonic waveguide consisting of a high-gain cadmium sulphide semiconductor nanowire, separated from a silver surface by a 5-nm-thick insulating gap. Direct measurements of the emission lifetime reveal a broad-band enhancement of the nanowire's exciton spontaneous emission rate by up to six times owing to the strong mode confinement and the signature of apparently threshold-less lasing. Because plasmonic modes have no cutoff, we are able to demonstrate downscaling of the lateral dimensions of both the device and the optical mode. Plasmonic lasers thus offer the possibility of exploring extreme interactions between light and matter, opening up new avenues in the fields of active photonic circuits, bio-sensing and quantum information technology.},

To achieve these features simultaneously, a platform is needed for which the various decay channels of embedded emitters can be fully understood and controlled. Here, we show that all these device requirements can be satisfied by a film-coupled metal nanocube system with emitters embedded in the dielectric gap region. Fluorescence lifetime measurements on ensembles of emitters reveal spontaneous emission rate enhancements exceeding 1,000 while maintaining high quantum efficiency ({\textgreater}0.5) and directional emission (84\% collection efficiency). Using angle-resolved fluorescence measurements, we independently determine the orientations of emission dipoles in the nanoscale gap. Incorporating this information with the three-dimensional spatial distribution of dipoles into full-wave simulations predicts time-resolved emission in excellent agreement with experiments.},

The film-thickness range was 185-500 Å. Three optical measurements were inverted to obtain the film thickness d as well as n and k. The estimated error in d was ± 2 Å, and that in n, k was less than 0.02 over most of the spectral range. The results in the film-thickness range 250-500 Å were independent of thickness, and were unchanged after vacuum annealing or aging in air. The free-electron optical effective masses and relaxation times derived from the results in the near infrared agree satisfactorily with previous values. The interband contribution to the imaginary part of the dielectric constant was obtained by subtracting the free-electron contribution.

The spaser has been predicted and observed experimentally as an active element—a generator of coherent local fields. Even greater progress will be achieved if the spaser can function as an ultrafast nanoamplifier—an optical counterpart of the MOSFET (metal–oxide–semiconductor field effect transistor). A formidable problem with this is that the spaser has inherent feedback, causing quantum generation of nanolocalized surface plasmons and saturation and consequent elimination of the net gain, making it unsuitable for amplification. We have overcome this inherent problem and shown that the spaser can perform functions of an ultrafast nanoamplifier in two modes: transient and bistable. On the basis of quantum density matrix (optical Bloch) equations we have shown that the spaser amplifies with gain \#\#IMG\#\# [http://ej.iop.org/images/2040-8986/12/2/024004/jopt340624ieqn1.gif] {\textbackslash}gtrsim 50 with a switching time \#\#IMG\#\# [http://ej.iop.org/images/2040-8986/12/2/024004/jopt340624ieqn2.gif] {\textbackslash}lesssim 100 fs (potentially, 10 fs).

	abstract = {One of the most rapidly growing areas of physics and nanotechnology focuses on plasmonic effects on the nanometre scale, with possible applications ranging from sensing and biomedicine to imaging and information technology. However, the full development of nanoplasmonics is hindered by the lack of devices that can generate coherent plasmonic fields. It has been proposed that in the same way as a laser generates stimulated emission of coherent photons, a 'spaser' could generate stimulated emission of surface plasmons (oscillations of free electrons in metallic nanostructures) in resonating metallic nanostructures adjacent to a gain medium. But attempts to realize a spaser face the challenge of absorption loss in metal, which is particularly strong at optical frequencies. The suggestion to compensate loss by optical gain in localized and propagating surface plasmons has been implemented recently and even allowed the amplification of propagating surface plasmons in open paths. Still, these experiments and the reported enhancement of the stimulated emission of dye molecules in the presence of metallic nanoparticles lack the feedback mechanism present in a spaser. Here we show that 44-nm-diameter nanoparticles with a gold core and dye-doped silica shell allow us to completely overcome the loss of localized surface plasmons by gain and realize a spaser. And in accord with the notion that only surface plasmon resonances are capable of squeezing optical frequency oscillations into a nanoscopic cavity to enable a true nanolaser, we show that outcoupling of surface plasmon oscillations to photonic modes at a wavelength of 531 nm makes our system the smallest nanolaser reported to date—and to our knowledge the first operating at visible wavelengths. We anticipate that now it has been realized experimentally, the spaser will advance our fundamental understanding of nanoplasmonics and the development of practical applications.},

We outline a theory to describe surface plasmon-polariton distributions when they are coupled to externally pumped molecules. The possibility of tailoring the dispersion in plasmonic lattices allows realization of a variety of distributions, including the Bose-Einstein distribution as in photon condensation [Klaers et al., Nature (London) 468, 545 (2010)]. We show that the presence of losses can relax some of the standard dimensionality restrictions for condensation.},

	abstract = {We study spatial coherence properties of a system composed of periodic silver nanoparticle arrays covered with a fluorescent organic molecule (DiD) film. The evolution of spatial coherence of this composite structure from the weak to the strong coupling regime is investigated by systematically varying the coupling strength between the localized DiD excitons and the collective, delocalized modes of the nanoparticle array known as surface lattice resonances. A gradual evolution of coherence from the weak to the strong coupling regime is observed, with the strong coupling features clearly visible in interference fringes. A high degree of spatial coherence is demonstrated in the strong coupling regime, even when the mode is very excitonlike (80\%), in contrast to the purely localized nature of molecular excitons. We show that coherence appears in proportion to the weight of the plasmonic component of the mode throughout the weak-to-strong coupling crossover, providing evidence for the hybrid nature of the normal modes.},

	abstract = {We show strong coupling involving three different types of resonances in plasmonic nanoarrays: surface lattice resonances (SLRs), localized surface plasmon resonances on single nanoparticles, and excitations of organic dye molecules. The measured transmission spectra show splittings that depend on the molecule concentration. The results are analyzed using finite-difference time-domain simulations, a coupled-dipole approximation, coupled-modes models, and Fano theory. The delocalized nature of the collective SLR modes suggests that in the strong coupling regime molecules near distant nanoparticles are coherently coupled.},

	abstract = {We make a step towards quantum nanoplasmonics: surface plasmon fields of a nanosystem are quantized and their stimulated emission is considered. We introduce a quantum generator for surface plasmon quanta and consider the phenomenon of surface plasmon amplification by stimulated emission of radiation (spaser). Spaser generates temporally coherent high-intensity fields of selected surface plasmon modes that can be strongly localized on the nanoscale, including dark modes that do not couple to far-zone electromagnetic fields. Applications and related phenomena are discussed.},
